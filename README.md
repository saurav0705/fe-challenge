# Assembly FE challenge

We appreciate you taking the time to work on these challenges. The first challenge (`./apps/01_js_challenge`) involves implementing a function that passes a test suite. The second challenge(`./apps/02_web_challenge`) involves implementing a small webapp. Each of the challenges includes instructions on the expectations of each challenge.

We strongly suggest spending at most 30 minutes on the first challenge and at most 2-3 hours on the second challenge.

In case of any questions, please reach out to siva@joinassembly.com & arun@joinassembly.com

## Setup

This monorepo uses npm. Please run `npm install` at the root level.

## Instructions

Once you've finished the setup, please create a branch where you can solve both challenges. Once you've completed the challenges, please raise a PR as you would with production-grade repos with any necessary information a reviewer would need to review your PR.
