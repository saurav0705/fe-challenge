# JSON Parsing challenge

You are given a text in JSON format in the form of a string consisting of small and capital English alphabets, curly brackets, double inverted commas, commas, and no spaces present anywhere.

You are also given the number of queries that'll be passed to the function you'll have to implement where each query will contain a key of the given JSON object in the form of a string.

## Task

For each query, you have to return the value of that key. Take a look at `./testCases.test.ts` to understand the input and output for your function. You cannot change the tests or the function signature of the input function in `./index.ts`. You'll have to implement `./index.ts` & make all the tests pass.

run `npm test` to start the test suite in watch mode
